  	<h2>Guide</h2>
  	<p>Use the "spot stagger angle" slider to create different wave patterns.
  	This slider changes the starting position of each spot compared to the previous spot, nudging it the specified increment along.</p>
  	<p>The circle grid density slider draws the background circles closer together or further apart, which defines the orbits of the spots.</p>
  	<p>Use the "Start/Stop cycle" button to cycle through the available angle increments. Notice how different angles produce different patterns.</p>
  	<p>Try pressing the pause animation button. Observe how as you move across each row, each spot's orbit is incremented by the amount specified by the stagger slider and shown in the "circle diagram" on the right. </p>
